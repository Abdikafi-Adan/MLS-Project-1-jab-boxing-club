							<p>Boxing is a sport of fighting with fists, also called pugilism (literally fist fight) and
								prizefighting (in other words, the fight for prizes/money). Boxing has been included in
								the Olympic Games program since 1904. For centuries people used their fists to resolve
								disputes before someone thought of organizing such fights as entertainment.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center ">BC Period</h3>

							<hr class="blcok-divider block-divider--orange">
							<p>There is a clear evidence that boxing existed as early as 1500 BC, on the Crete Island.
								The modern researchers insist that such duels had been known even earlier than that, in
								Africa, specifically in the region of modern Ethiopia.</p>

                                <p>
								The hieroglyphic scriptures dated back to the year 4000 BC revealed the popularity of
								this sport throughout the Nile Plateau and all over the Egypt, after the latter had
								conquered Ethiopia. The enhancement of the Egyptian civilization through the
								Mediterranean region and the Middle East caused boxing to spread its influence. In the
								year 686 BC boxing became an essential part of the Olympics.</p>
                                 <p>   
								However, ancient boxing barely resembles the sport we admire today. All fights were
								carried out on open plots, where the spectators formed a living arena. The fight
								normally lasted until one of the opponents was seriously injured. Although the first
								boxers primarily fought for glory, the winner was also granted the gold, livestock or
								other trophies.</p>
                                <p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								To protect wrists and hands the fighters braided their fists and sometimes two thirds of
								their forearms with thin soft leather straps. By the 4th century BC the straps were made
								of harder leather and were used not just as an arm protection gadget but turned the
								fists into the kind of assault weapon. Later, in the Roman Empire, the leather straps
								were armored with special copper and iron brackets used in gladiators’ fights which
								usually ended with the death of one of the fighters.</p>

							<h3 class="text-center">Common Era</h3>
							<hr class="blcok-divider block-divider--orange">
							<p> With the spread of Christianity and the collapse of the Roman Empire, fist fights ceased
								to exist as an entertainment and were forgotten for several centuries. The first
								official bout was registered in England in 1681. And since 1698 regularly scheduled
								boxing matches were conducted in the Royal Theater in London.
							</p>
							<p>
								Gradually London became the center for provincial boxing champions seeking fame, glory
								and money. That very reason was an incentive for the boxing development in London in
								particular. In those bouts each boxer’s remuneration as well as the percentage of stakes
								gambled by spectators were settled. The fighters did not use gloves and did not follow
								common rules. Weight classification was not determined, which resulted in only one
								Champion announcement. The lightweight boxers were often beaten. Though rounds were
								determined, a fight usually lasted until one of the opponents was unable to continue the
								fight. It was not prohibited to attack an opponent even after he fell to the ground.
								These conditions existed until mid-XVI century. </p>
							<p>
								Despite the fact that the boxing was outlawed, it was gaining more and more popularity.
								In 1719, James Figg, the favorite of the public and the winner of many boxing matches,
								was proclaimed the Champion of England and held the title for fifteen years. Jack
								Brownton, one of James Figg’s followers, made an attempt to turn fist-fighting matches
								of the time into real athletic competition. </p>
							<p>
								In 1743 Jack Brownton wrote the first Code of Rules, and those rules, with minor
								modifications, were used until 1838, when they were replaced by the updated ‘London
								Prize Ring Rules’. Broughton abolished the fighting methods widely used by his
								predecessors (mostly the tactics of drunkard’s boozy brawls in pubs), giving the
								preference to hands fight only. The boxers were forbidden to punch beneath the waist.
								Under Brownton’s rules, the fight lasted until one of the fighters was knocked down. If
								he then was unable to enter the ring and take his stand within one-yard range from his
								opponent, he was considered a loser.</p>
							<p>
								It was forbidden to punch the opponent after he was beaten, his handlers had 30 seconds
								to get him into position on one side of the square, facing his opponent. Jack Brownton
								was recognized as the ‘Father of Boxing’. He opened a training gym to coach his
								followers. He also invented ‘mufflers’, the first boxing gloves, to protect boxers’
								hands and faces.</p>

							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								When Jack Slack had beaten Brownton, the fights for the title of Champion became more
								regular. The boxing lost its appeal as something extraordinary, and the public’s
								interest towards this sport decreased slightly, though such fighters as Daniel Mendoza
								and John ‘Gentleman’ Jackson were still extremely popular.</p>
							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								Daniel Mendoza weighed 160 pounds (76 kg) and had a strong and quick left punch. After
								his victory over Mendoza, Jackson contributed to the financial qualification model of
								prizing that gave boxing more respectability. In 1814, in London, The Boxing Society was
								founded. The London Prize Ring Rules, which were widely used both in England and America
								were adopted by that Society in 1838. These rules were used for the first time in 1838,
								when James ‘Deaf’ Zamnet lost his title of The Champion of England in his fight versus
								William ‘Bendigo’ Thompson.</p>
							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								The fight was conducted on the 24 square feet ring, bounded by two ropes from each side.
								When one of the fighters fell on the ring floor, the round was ended. At that time, the
								injured boxer was attended to in the corner of the ring during a 30-second break. After
								a 30-second break, the opponents were to take their stands in the ring center and the
								next round would begin. If one of the opponents did not enter the ring center within
								eight seconds, the other one was proclaimed a winner. It was forbidden to curse,
								quarrel, hit with heads and legs, and to hit beneath the waist on the ring. All those
								actions were claimed inappropriate during the ring fighting.

							<h3 class="text-center">TV and Professional Boxing</h3>
							<hr class="blcok-divider block-divider--orange">
							<p>
								The TV was playing a significant role in professional boxing promotion after the World
								War II. Because of relatively low funds needed to be invested into professional boxing
								matches broadcasting from the mid 1950s, boxing broadcasts became more regular than
								other sport events. The interest towards professional boxing broadcasting decreased
								after 1962. However, in 1976 when five American boxers won the Olympic gold and then
								entered the rank of professionals, the interest of the TV audience in boxing matches
								grew again. The introduction of the cable TV in the USA in the mid 1980s influenced the
								emergence of a large number of professional clubs where young boxers were coached and
								trained. </p>

							<p>
								TV broadcasts have significantly increased the professional boxing returns. The
								multimillion earnings gained from the fights for the Super Heavyweight World Champion
								title in the mid 1960s became a part of the deal. The boxing legend, Muhammad Ali earned
								over $ 69,000,000 during his 20 year-long career.</p>

							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								On April 6, 1987 two famous welterweights Ray “Sugar” Leonard and Marvin Hagler shared
								the fees of $ 30,000,000. In addition to TV broadcases, professional boxing
								popularization in America and Europe was done through arrangements of boxing matches in
								casinos. The most prestigious casinos in Las-Vegas, Atlantic City and New Jersey
								profited from professional boxing tournaments, although those boxing shows were
								worldwide recognized as well.

							<h3 class="text-center">The Style</h3>
							<hr class="blcok-divider block-divider--orange">
							<p>
								In the past, when boxers arranged their tournaments bare-knuckled, the fight was focused
								only on the power of delivered punch. Such style was followed until one of the opponents
								became unable to continue fighting. The hands of a boxer didn’t have a definite
								position, neither did the legs’ movements. When the boxing gloves were introduced
								together with the scoring system and the boxers had a chance to win by scores, boxing
								tactics, comprising both hands and legs movements became more important. James G.
								Corbett was the first modern heavyweight boxer who focused on the boxing tactics.
							</p>
                            <p>
								The heavyweight Champ Jack Dempsey was very famous among the spectators because of his
								aggressive fight tactics and his attempts to end the fight by knockouts. Dempsey
								conducted the fight using the low standing position, pending as a pendulum and allowing
								his opponent to attack.</p>
                                <p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								The Champ Joe Louis improved the “stalking” style, which he used to persecute the
								opponent across the ring until he ultimately knocked him down. The super heavyweight
								Mike Tyson, in the late 1980s won the WBA, WBC and IBF World Champion titles using the
								same tactics in boxing.</p>
                                <p>
								Prior to Muhammad Ali, it was believed that super heavyweights could not move fast
								across the ring. But Ali proved that he was the fastest heavyweight of his time. As if
								he would dance around his opponents with the hanging hands able to quickly take a
								standing for defense and attack. Although he did not have crashing punches, he won a lot
								of fights by knockouts conducting the powerful and quick punches combinations.</p>
                                <p class="d-none d-md-block ">
								The choice of the style is very individual for each boxer, however, swift moves and
								precise punches are the two key elements in the modern boxing tactics.
