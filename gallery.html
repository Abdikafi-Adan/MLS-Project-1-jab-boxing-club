								Muhammad Ali can’t be overtaken when it comes to cultural and political influence. His

							<p>Sugar Ray Robinson born  May 3, 1921, hailed by Muhammad Ali as “the
								king, the master, my idol,” was the
								inspiration for the “pound for pound” ranking, used to describe a boxer whose skill in
								the ring puts him above every other fighter in the world, in any weight division. He was
								the welterweight champion for five consecutive years (1946 to 1951) and a five-time
								middleweight champion between 1951 and 1960). Another boxing legend, Sugar Ray Leonard,
								was quoted as saying, “Someone once said there’s a comparison between Sugar Ray Leonard
								and Sugar Ray Robinson. Believe me, there’s no comparison. Sugar Ray Robinson was the
								greatest.”
							</p>
							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">Robinson was 85–0 as an amateur with 69 of those victories coming by way of knockout, 40
								in the first round. He turned professional in 1940 at the age of 19 and by 1951 had a
								professional record of 128–1–2 with 84 knockouts. From 1943 to 1951 Robinson went on a
								91-fight unbeaten streak, the third-longest in professional boxing history.Robinson held
								the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951, and won the world middleweight title in
								the latter year. He retired in 1952, only to come back two-and-a-half years later and
								regain the middleweight title in 1955. He then became the first boxer in history to win
								a divisional world championship five times (a feat he accomplished by defeating Carmen
								Basilio in 1958 to regain the middleweight championship). Robinson was named "fighter of
								the year" twice: first for his performances in 1942, then nine years and over 90 fights
								later, for his efforts.</p>

							<p>Mike Tyson born June 30, 1966 is an American former professional boxer who competed from
								1985
								to 2005. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion and holds the record as
								the
								youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title, at 20 years, four months, and 22 days
								old.Tyson
								won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. He won
								the WBC title in 1986 after stopping Trevor Berbick in the second round, and added
								the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987. This made
								Tyson
								the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, and the
								only
								heavyweight to successively unify them.

							</p>
							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">Tyson became the lineal champion in 1988 when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds
								of
								the first round. He successfully defended his titles nine times, which included
								victories
								over Larry Holmes and Frank Bruno. In 1990, Tyson lost the titles to underdog Buster
								Douglas, who knocked him out in the tenth round. Attempting to regain the titles, Tyson
								defeated Donovan Ruddock twice in 1991, but pulled out of a fight with then-undisputed
								heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield (who had defeated Douglas later in 1990) due to a
								rib
								injury. </p>

							<p class="d-none d-md-block ">Known for his relentless fighting style, formidable punching power, stamina, and
